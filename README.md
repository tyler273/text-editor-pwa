## Description

The goal of this project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser and also functions offline. This was possible by completing code in which a manifest sile was created and a service worker was registered, thus allowing for access while offline!

## Installation

First, the user must install Node.js in order for the app to run!

Then, the user must type `npm install` into the integrated terminal in order to install all of the necessary dependencies. Then, the user must type `npm run start` which will run the build and start the server!

Lastly, the user must also install mongoose using `npm i mongoose` for the Object Data Modeling library that connects MongoDB and Node.js.

## Usage

Deployed application will be linked here!

## Credits

I was able to complete the assignment through tutoring from my fellow peer [Myro Lee](https://github.com/myrojoylee)!
